Summary:
For HDB Data:
-> use https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/transport/carpark-availability
-> pair this with the csv containing all HDB carpark names.
(Datamall has HDB data too, but it requires multiple requests to get all the records...)

For Malls and URA carparks:
-> use Datamall (only need the first 500 records)
-> Datamall has the names there already, don't need to pair with the csv.


Data Sources:
- Data.gov.sg
- CSV containing all HDB carparks - https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_23f946fa557947f93a8043bbef41dd09/view 

- LTA Datamall API - 2482 records in total (returns maximum of 500 records at a time.)

TODOs:

- Settle text alignment, and button alignment 
- Settle the colours (do one version first, think of dark/light later)

- Need an error page (WILL DO THIS) -> See if bootstrap has any you can use.

Think of adding additional functionality:
- light / dark mode

Things to add in dockerfile:
- csv file
- icons
- double check if anything else

- Remember to tidy up the code.

List of things to talk about:
- Show filtering (typos too) *****Remember to test the tolerence again*****
- Show google maps link (Be sure to choose the links that directly show a carpark)
